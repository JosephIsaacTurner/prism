# Prism

**Fast, modular, and extensible permutation-based statistical inference for neuroimaging.**

Prism is a Python library for running fast, scalable, and fully nonparametric statistical analyses on brain imaging data. It replicates much of the core functionality of Anderson Winkler's [PALM](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM), but without MATLAB dependencies.

## 📚 Documentation

Full documentation, including API reference and usage guides, is available at:  
**[https://josephiturner.com/prism/](https://josephiturner.com/prism/)**

For background and motivation, see the [project manuscript](manuscript/manuscript.md).

## 🚀 Features

- **Mass univariate GLM analysis** with flexible contrast modeling
- **Permutation-based testing** including sign flips and blockwise shuffling
- **Support for TFCE**, FDR, FWE (Westfall–Young), and GPD-based p-value tail estimation
- **Voxelwise map comparison tools** for assessing spatial similarity
- **CLI interface** modeled after PALM
- Works directly with **NIfTI files** or **NumPy arrays**

## 🛠️ Installation

Prism is available on PyPI as `prism-neuro`:

```bash
pip install prism-neuro
```

Note: While the package is named `prism-neuro` on PyPI, you still use `import prism` in your code.

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephisaacturner/prism.git
cd prism
pip install -e .
```

If you're on MacOS with Apple silicon, you may need to manually install a jax dependency:

```bash
pip install jax-metal
```

## Minimal Example

```python
import numpy as np
from prism.datasets.dataset import Dataset

Y = np.random.randn(100, 50)        # Brain data (samples x voxels)
X = np.random.randn(100, 2)         # Design matrix
C = np.array([1, -1])               # Contrast

dataset = Dataset(
    data=Y,
    design=X,
    contrast=C,
    output_prefix="prism_example",
    n_permutations=1000
)

results = dataset.permutation_analysis()
```
